# Handy-Unity-Scripts
Some scripts that I've made for unity that simplifies workflow.
All scripts should be placed in the Assets folder of your project. I would recommend collecting them in a folder called "Plugins".

## Add_Dynamic_Bone.cs:
Script that adds the dynamic bone script to array of objects.

Made for Dynamic Bone version 1.2.2

Current version: 1.2

This script adds the dynamic-bone script to an array of objects. Contains all the parameters that the dynamic bone script includes.

### How to use: 

1. Open the tool by going to Tools â†’ Sivert â†’ "Dynamic Bone Adder".
2. Populate the Array at the top of the script with the gameobjects you want to add the dynamic bone script component to.
3. Change settings as you wish.
4. Press the button close to the bottom of the tool-window that says "Add script to bone(s)".

### Extra:

5. To update every script added to the bones, press the button that says "Update bone(s)".
6. To copy the settings from the bones to the tool, press the button that says "Copy settings from bone(s)".
7. To remove the dynamic bone script from the bones, press the button that says "Remove script from bone(s)".
