# Handy-Unity-Scripts
Some scripts that I've made for unity that simplifies workflow.

## Add_Dynamic_Bone.cs:
Script that adds the dynamic bone script to array of objects.
Made for Dynamic Bone version 1.2.2

This script adds the dynamic-bone script to an array of objects. Contains all the parameters that the dynamic bone script includes.

How to use: 
1. Add the script to any gameobject in your scene.
2. Populate the Array at the top of the script with the gameobjects you want to add the dynamic bone script component to.
3. Double-check all your settings and check the box at the bottom that says "Check When Ready".
4. Right click the script-name in your inspector-panel and select "Click here to add the script(s) to the bone(s)". Your selected bones will now have the script-component added with all the values you selected.

To undo, simply right click the script-name in your inspector-panel and select "Click here to remove the script(s) to the bone(s)".

You can also click the three small dots to the right of the script-name to open the same context menu as right clicking.
